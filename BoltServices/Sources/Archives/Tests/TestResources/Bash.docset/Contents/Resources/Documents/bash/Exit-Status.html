<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-exit-status-1"></a>

<p>The exit status of an executed command is the value returned by the
<code class="code">waitpid</code> system call or equivalent function.
Exit statuses fall between 0 and 255, though, as explained below,
the shell may use values above 125 specially.
Exit statuses from shell builtins and compound commands are also limited
to this range.
Under certain circumstances, the shell will use special values to
indicate specific failure modes.
</p>
<p>For the shell&rsquo;s purposes, a command which exits with a
zero exit status has succeeded.
So while an exit status of zero indicates success, a non-zero
exit status indicates failure.
This seemingly counter-intuitive scheme is used so there
is one well-defined way to indicate success and a variety of
ways to indicate various failure modes.
</p>
<p>When a command terminates on a fatal signal whose number is <var class="var">N</var>,
Bash uses the value 128+<var class="var">N</var> as the exit status.
</p>
<p>If a command is not found, the child process created to
execute it returns a status of 127.
If a command is found but is not executable, the return status is 126.
</p>
<p>If a command fails because of an error during expansion or redirection,
the exit status is greater than zero.
</p>
<p>The exit status is used by the Bash conditional commands
(see <a class="pxref" href="Conditional-Constructs.html">Conditional Constructs</a>) and some of the list
constructs (see <a class="pxref" href="Lists.html">Lists of Commands</a>).
</p>
<p>All of the Bash builtins return an exit status of zero if they succeed
and a non-zero status on failure, so they may be used by the
conditional and list constructs.
All builtins return an exit status of 2 to indicate incorrect usage,
generally invalid options or missing arguments.
</p>
<p>The exit status of the last command is available in the special
parameter $? (see <a class="pxref" href="Special-Parameters.html">Special Parameters</a>).
</p>
<p>Bash itself returns the exit status of the last command
executed, unless a syntax error occurs, in which case it exits
with a non-zero value.
See also the <code class="code">exit</code> builtin command (see <a class="pxref" href="Bourne-Shell-Builtins.html">Bourne Shell Builtins</a>.
