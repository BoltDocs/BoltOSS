<h3 class="section" id="Bash-Startup-Files-1"><span>6.2 Bash Startup Files<a class="copiable-link" href="#Bash-Startup-Files-1"> &para;</a></span></h3>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-startup-files"></a>

<p>This section describes how Bash executes its startup files.
If any of the files exist but cannot be read, Bash reports an error.
Tildes are expanded in filenames as described above under
Tilde Expansion (see <a class="pxref" href="Tilde-Expansion.html">Tilde Expansion</a>).
</p>
<p>Interactive shells are described in <a class="ref" href="Interactive-Shells.html">Interactive Shells</a>.
</p>
<h4 class="subsubheading" id="Invoked-as-an-interactive-login-shell_002c-or-with-_002d_002dlogin"><span>Invoked as an interactive login shell, or with <samp class="option">--login</samp><a class="copiable-link" href="#Invoked-as-an-interactive-login-shell_002c-or-with-_002d_002dlogin"> &para;</a></span></h4>

<p>When Bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a
non-interactive shell with the <samp class="option">--login</samp> option, it first reads and
executes commands from the file <samp class="file">/etc/profile</samp>, if that file exists.
After reading that file, it looks for <samp class="file">~/.bash_profile</samp>,
<samp class="file">~/.bash_login</samp>, and <samp class="file">~/.profile</samp>, in that order, and reads
and executes commands from the first one that exists and is readable.
The
<samp class="option">--noprofile</samp>
option inhibits this behavior.
</p>
<p>When an interactive login shell exits,
or a non-interactive login shell executes the <code class="code">exit</code> builtin command,
Bash reads and executes commands from
the file <samp class="file">~/.bash_logout</samp>, if it exists.
</p>
<h4 class="subsubheading" id="Invoked-as-an-interactive-non_002dlogin-shell"><span>Invoked as an interactive non-login shell<a class="copiable-link" href="#Invoked-as-an-interactive-non_002dlogin-shell"> &para;</a></span></h4>

<p>When Bash runs as an interactive shell that is not a login shell, it
reads and executes commands from <samp class="file">~/.bashrc</samp>, if that file exists.
The <samp class="option">--norc</samp> option inhibits this behavior.
The <samp class="option">--rcfile <var class="var">file</var></samp> option
causes Bash to
use <var class="var">file</var> instead of <samp class="file">~/.bashrc</samp>.
</p>
<p>So, typically, your <samp class="file">~/.bash_profile</samp> contains the line
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted"><code class="code">if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then . ~/.bashrc; fi</code>
</pre></div>
<p>after (or before) any login-specific initializations.
</p>
<h4 class="subsubheading" id="Invoked-non_002dinteractively"><span>Invoked non-interactively<a class="copiable-link" href="#Invoked-non_002dinteractively"> &para;</a></span></h4>

<p>When Bash is started non-interactively, to run a shell script,
for example, it looks for the variable <code class="env">BASH_ENV</code> in the environment,
expands its value if it appears there, and uses the expanded value as
the name of a file to read and execute.
Bash behaves as if the following command were executed:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted"><code class="code">if [ -n &quot;$BASH_ENV&quot; ]; then . &quot;$BASH_ENV&quot;; fi</code>
</pre></div>
<p>but does not the value of the <code class="env">PATH</code> variable to search for the
filename.
</p>
<p>As noted above, if a non-interactive shell is invoked with the
<samp class="option">--login</samp> option,
Bash attempts to read and execute commands from the
login shell startup files. 
</p>
<h4 class="subsubheading" id="Invoked-with-name-sh"><span>Invoked with name <code class="code">sh</code><a class="copiable-link" href="#Invoked-with-name-sh"> &para;</a></span></h4>

<p>If Bash is invoked with the name <code class="command">sh</code>,
it tries to mimic the startup behavior of historical versions of
<code class="command">sh</code> as closely as possible,
while conforming to the
<small class="sc">POSIX</small>
standard as well.
</p>
<p>When invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive
shell with the <samp class="option">--login</samp> option, it first attempts to read
and execute commands from
<samp class="file">/etc/profile</samp> and <samp class="file">~/.profile</samp>,
in that order.
The <samp class="option">--noprofile</samp> option inhibits this behavior.
</p>
<p>When invoked as an interactive shell with the name <code class="command">sh</code>, Bash
looks for the variable <code class="env">ENV</code>,
expands its value if it is defined, and uses the
expanded value as the name of a file to read and execute.
Since a shell invoked as <code class="command">sh</code>
does not attempt to read and execute commands from any other startup
files, the
<samp class="option">--rcfile</samp>
option has no effect.
</p>
<p>A non-interactive shell invoked with the name <code class="command">sh</code>
does not attempt to read any other startup files.
</p>
<p>When invoked as <code class="command">sh</code>, Bash enters <small class="sc">POSIX</small> mode after reading
the startup files.
</p>
<h4 class="subsubheading" id="Invoked-in-posix-mode"><span>Invoked in <small class="sc">POSIX</small> mode<a class="copiable-link" href="#Invoked-in-posix-mode"> &para;</a></span></h4>

<p>When Bash is started in <small class="sc">POSIX</small> mode, as with the
<samp class="option">--posix</samp> command line option, it follows the
<small class="sc">POSIX</small>
standard for startup files.
In this mode, interactive shells expand the <code class="env">ENV</code> variable
and read and execute commands from the file whose name is the
expanded value.
No other startup files are read.
</p>
<h4 class="subsubheading" id="Invoked-by-remote-shell-daemon"><span>Invoked by remote shell daemon<a class="copiable-link" href="#Invoked-by-remote-shell-daemon"> &para;</a></span></h4>

<p>Bash
attempts to determine when it is being run with its standard input
connected to a network connection, as when executed by
the historical and rarely-seen remote shell daemon, usually <code class="code">rshd</code>,
or the secure shell daemon <code class="code">sshd</code>.
If
Bash
determines it is being run non-interactively in this fashion,
it reads and executes commands from
<samp class="file">~/.bashrc</samp>,
if that file exists and is readable.
Bash does not read this file if invoked as <code class="code">sh</code>.
The
<samp class="option">--norc</samp>
option inhibits this behavior, and the
<samp class="option">--rcfile</samp>
option makes Bash use a different file instead of
<samp class="file">~/.bashrc</samp>,
but neither
<code class="code">rshd</code> nor <code class="code">sshd</code> generally invoke the shell with those
options or allow them to be specified.
</p>
<h4 class="subsubheading" id="Invoked-with-unequal-effective-and-real-uid_002fgids"><span>Invoked with unequal effective and real <small class="sc">UID/GID</small>s<a class="copiable-link" href="#Invoked-with-unequal-effective-and-real-uid_002fgids"> &para;</a></span></h4>

<p>If Bash is started with the effective user (group) id not equal to the
real user (group) id, and the <samp class="option">-p</samp> option is not supplied, no startup
files are read, shell functions are not inherited from the environment,
the <code class="env">SHELLOPTS</code>, <code class="env">BASHOPTS</code>, <code class="env">CDPATH</code>, and <code class="env">GLOBIGNORE</code>
variables, if they appear in the environment, are ignored, and the effective
user id is set to the real user id.
If the <samp class="option">-p</samp> option is supplied at invocation, the startup behavior is
the same, but the effective user id is not reset.
