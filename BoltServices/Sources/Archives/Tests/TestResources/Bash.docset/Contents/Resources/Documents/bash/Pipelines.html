<span id="Pipelines-1"></span><h4 class="subsection">3.2.3 Pipelines</h4>
<span id="index-pipeline"></span>
<span id="index-commands_002c-pipelines"></span>

<p>A <code>pipeline</code> is a sequence of one or more commands separated by
one of the control operators ‘<samp>|</samp>’ or ‘<samp>|&amp;</samp>’.
</p>
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Word/time"></a><span id="index-time"></span>
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Word/%21"></a><span id="index-_0021"></span>
<span id="index-command-timing"></span>
<p>The format for a pipeline is
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">[time [-p]] [!] <var>command1</var> [ | or |&amp; <var>command2</var> ] …
</pre></div>

<p>The output of each command in the pipeline is connected via a pipe
to the input of the next command.
That is, each command reads the previous command’s output.  This
connection is performed before any redirections specified by
<var>command1</var>.
</p>
<p>If ‘<samp>|&amp;</samp>’ is used, <var>command1</var>’s standard error, in addition to
its standard output, is connected to
<var>command2</var>’s standard input through the pipe;
it is shorthand for <code>2&gt;&amp;1 |</code>.
This implicit redirection of the standard error to the standard output is
performed after any redirections specified by <var>command1</var>.
</p>
<p>The reserved word <code>time</code> causes timing statistics
to be printed for the pipeline once it finishes.
The statistics currently consist of elapsed (wall-clock) time and
user and system time consumed by the command’s execution.
The <samp>-p</samp> option changes the output format to that specified
by <small>POSIX</small>.
When the shell is in <small>POSIX</small> mode (see <a href="Bash-POSIX-Mode.html">Bash POSIX Mode</a>),
it does not recognize <code>time</code> as a reserved word if the next
token begins with a ‘<samp>-</samp>’.
The <code>TIMEFORMAT</code> variable may be set to a format string that
specifies how the timing information should be displayed.
See <a href="Bash-Variables.html">Bash Variables</a>, for a description of the available formats.
The use of <code>time</code> as a reserved word permits the timing of
shell builtins, shell functions, and pipelines.  An external
<code>time</code> command cannot time these easily.
</p>
<p>When the shell is in <small>POSIX</small> mode (see <a href="Bash-POSIX-Mode.html">Bash POSIX Mode</a>), <code>time</code>
may be followed by a newline.  In this case, the shell displays the
total user and system time consumed by the shell and its children.
The <code>TIMEFORMAT</code> variable may be used to specify the format of
the time information.
</p>
<p>If the pipeline is not executed asynchronously (see <a href="Lists.html">Lists of Commands</a>), the
shell waits for all commands in the pipeline to complete.
</p>
<p>Each command in a multi-command pipeline,
where pipes are created,
is executed in its own <em>subshell</em>, which is a
separate process (see <a href="Command-Execution-Environment.html">Command Execution Environment</a>).
If the <code>lastpipe</code> option is enabled using the <code>shopt</code> builtin
(see <a href="The-Shopt-Builtin.html">The Shopt Builtin</a>),
the last element of a pipeline may be run by the shell process
when job control is not active.
</p>
<p>The exit
status of a pipeline is the exit status of the last command in the
pipeline, unless the <code>pipefail</code> option is enabled
(see <a href="The-Set-Builtin.html">The Set Builtin</a>).
If <code>pipefail</code> is enabled, the pipeline’s return status is the
value of the last (rightmost) command to exit with a non-zero status,
or zero if all commands exit successfully.
If the reserved word ‘<samp>!</samp>’ precedes the pipeline, the
exit status is the logical negation of the exit status as described
above.
The shell waits for all commands in the pipeline to terminate before
returning a value.
