<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-pipeline"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-commands_002c-pipelines"></a>

<p>A <code class="code">pipeline</code> is a sequence of one or more commands separated by
one of the control operators ‘<samp class="samp">|</samp>’ or ‘<samp class="samp">|&amp;</samp>’.
</p>
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Word/time"></a><a class="index-entry-id" id="index-time"></a>
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Word/%21"></a><a class="index-entry-id" id="index-_0021"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-command-timing"></a>
<p>The format for a pipeline is
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">[time [-p]] [!] <var class="var">command1</var> [ | or |&amp; <var class="var">command2</var> ] ...
</pre></div>

<p>The output of each command in the pipeline is connected via a pipe
to the input of the next command.
That is, each command reads the previous command’s output.
This connection is performed before any redirections specified by
<var class="var">command1</var>.
</p>
<p>If ‘<samp class="samp">|&amp;</samp>’ is the pipeline operator,
<var class="var">command1</var>’s standard error, in addition to
its standard output, is connected to
<var class="var">command2</var>’s standard input through the pipe;
it is shorthand for <code class="code">2&gt;&amp;1 |</code>.
This implicit redirection of the standard error to the standard output is
performed after any redirections specified by <var class="var">command1</var>,
consistent with that shorthand.
</p>
<p>If the reserved word <code class="code">time</code> precedes the pipeline,
Bash prints timing statistics for the pipeline once it finishes.
The statistics currently consist of elapsed (wall-clock) time and
user and system time consumed by the command’s execution.
The <samp class="option">-p</samp> option changes the output format to that specified
by <small class="sc">POSIX</small>.
When the shell is in <small class="sc">POSIX</small> mode (see <a class="pxref" href="Bash-POSIX-Mode.html">Bash and POSIX</a>),
it does not recognize <code class="code">time</code> as a reserved word if the next
token begins with a ‘<samp class="samp">-</samp>’.
The value of the <code class="env">TIMEFORMAT</code> variable is a format string that
specifies how the timing information should be displayed.
See <a class="xref" href="Bash-Variables.html">Bash Variables</a>, for a description of the available formats.
Providing <code class="code">time</code> as a reserved word permits the timing of
shell builtins, shell functions, and pipelines.
An external <code class="code">time</code> command cannot time these easily.
</p>
<p>When the shell is in <small class="sc">POSIX</small> mode (see <a class="pxref" href="Bash-POSIX-Mode.html">Bash and POSIX</a>),
you can use <code class="code">time</code> by itself as a simple command.
In this case, the shell displays the
total user and system time consumed by the shell and its children.
The <code class="env">TIMEFORMAT</code> variable specifies the format of the time information.
</p>
<p>If a pipeline is not executed asynchronously (see <a class="pxref" href="Lists.html">Lists of Commands</a>), the
shell waits for all commands in the pipeline to complete.
</p>
<p>Each command in a multi-command pipeline,
where pipes are created,
is executed in its own <em class="dfn">subshell</em>, which is a
separate process (see <a class="pxref" href="Command-Execution-Environment.html">Command Execution Environment</a>).
If the <code class="code">lastpipe</code> option is enabled using the <code class="code">shopt</code> builtin
(see <a class="pxref" href="The-Shopt-Builtin.html">The Shopt Builtin</a>),
and  job control is not active,
the last element of a pipeline may be run by the shell process.
</p>
<p>The exit
status of a pipeline is the exit status of the last command in the
pipeline, unless the <code class="code">pipefail</code> option is enabled
(see <a class="pxref" href="The-Set-Builtin.html">The Set Builtin</a>).
If <code class="code">pipefail</code> is enabled, the pipeline’s return status is the
value of the last (rightmost) command to exit with a non-zero status,
or zero if all commands exit successfully.
If the reserved word ‘<samp class="samp">!</samp>’ precedes the pipeline, the
exit status is the logical negation of the exit status as described
above.
If a pipeline is not executed asynchronously (see <a class="pxref" href="Lists.html">Lists of Commands</a>), the
shell waits for all commands in the pipeline to terminate before
returning a value.
The return status of an asynchronous pipeline is 0.
