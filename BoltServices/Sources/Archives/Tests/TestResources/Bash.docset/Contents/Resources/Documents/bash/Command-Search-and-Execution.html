<p>After a command has been split into words, if it results in a
simple command and an optional list of arguments, the shell performs
the following actions.
</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li> If the command name contains no slashes, the shell attempts to
locate it.
If there exists a shell function by that name, that
function is invoked as described in <a class="ref" href="Shell-Functions.html">Shell Functions</a>.

</li><li> If the name does not match a function, the shell searches for
it in the list of shell builtins.
If a match is found, that builtin is invoked.

</li><li> If the name is neither a shell function nor a builtin,
and contains no slashes, Bash searches each element of
<code class="env">$PATH</code> for a directory containing an executable file
by that name.
Bash uses a hash table to remember the full
pathnames of executable files to avoid multiple <code class="env">PATH</code> searches
(see the description of <code class="code">hash</code> in <a class="ref" href="Bourne-Shell-Builtins.html">Bourne Shell Builtins</a>).
Bash performs a full search of the directories in <code class="env">$PATH</code>
only if the command is not found in the hash table.
If the search is unsuccessful, the shell searches for a defined shell
function named <code class="code">command_not_found_handle</code>.
If that function exists, it is invoked in a separate execution environment
with the original command and
the original command&rsquo;s arguments as its arguments, and the function&rsquo;s
exit status becomes the exit status of that subshell.
If that function is not defined, the shell prints an error
message and returns an exit status of 127.

</li><li> If the search is successful, or if the command name contains
one or more slashes, the shell executes the named program in
a separate execution environment.
Argument 0 is set to the name given, and the remaining arguments
to the command are set to the arguments supplied, if any.

</li><li> If this execution fails because the file is not in executable
format, and the file is not a directory, it is assumed to be a
<em class="dfn">shell script</em>,
a file containing shell commands,
and the shell executes it as described in <a class="ref" href="Shell-Scripts.html">Shell Scripts</a>.

</li><li> If the command was not begun asynchronously, the shell waits for
the command to complete and collects its exit status.

</li></ol>
