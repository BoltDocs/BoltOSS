<p>At its base, a shell is simply a macro processor that executes commands.
The term macro processor means functionality where text
and symbols are expanded to create larger expressions.
</p>
<p>A Unix shell is both a command interpreter and a programming language.
As a command interpreter, the shell provides the user
interface to the rich set of <small class="sc">GNU</small> utilities.
The programming language features allow these utilities to be combined.
Users can create files containing commands, and these become
commands themselves. 
These new commands have the same status as
system commands in directories such as <samp class="file">/bin</samp>, allowing users
or groups to establish custom environments to automate their common
tasks.
</p>
<p>Shells may be used interactively or non-interactively.  In
interactive mode, they accept input typed from the keyboard.
When executing non-interactively, shells execute commands read
from a file or a string.
</p>
<p>A shell allows execution of <small class="sc">GNU</small> commands, both synchronously and
asynchronously.
The shell waits for synchronous commands to complete before accepting
more input; asynchronous commands continue to execute in parallel
with the shell while it reads and executes additional commands.
The <em class="dfn">redirection</em> constructs permit
fine-grained control of the input and output of those commands.
Moreover, the shell allows control over the contents of commands&rsquo;
environments.
</p>
<p>Shells also provide a small set of built-in
commands (<em class="dfn">builtins</em>) implementing functionality impossible
or inconvenient to obtain via separate utilities.
For example, <code class="code">cd</code>, <code class="code">break</code>, <code class="code">continue</code>, and
<code class="code">exec</code> cannot be implemented outside of the shell because
they directly manipulate the shell itself.
The <code class="code">history</code>, <code class="code">getopts</code>, <code class="code">kill</code>, or <code class="code">pwd</code>
builtins, among others, could be implemented in separate utilities,
but they are more convenient to use as builtin commands.
All of the shell builtins are described in subsequent sections.
</p>
<p>While executing commands is essential, most of the power (and
complexity) of shells is due to their embedded programming languages. 
Like any high-level language, the shell provides variables,
flow control constructs, quoting, and functions. 
</p>
<p>Shells offer features geared specifically for
interactive use rather than to augment the programming language. 
These interactive features include job control, command line
editing, command history and aliases.
This manual describes how Bash provides all of these features.
