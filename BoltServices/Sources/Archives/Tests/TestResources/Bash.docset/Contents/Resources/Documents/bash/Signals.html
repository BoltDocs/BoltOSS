<span id="Signals-1"></span><h4 class="subsection">3.7.6 Signals</h4>
<span id="index-signal-handling"></span>

<p>When Bash is interactive, in the absence of any traps, it ignores
<code>SIGTERM</code> (so that &lsquo;<samp>kill 0</samp>&rsquo; does not kill an interactive shell),
and <code>SIGINT</code>
is caught and handled (so that the <code>wait</code> builtin is interruptible).
When Bash receives a <code>SIGINT</code>, it breaks out of any executing loops.
In all cases, Bash ignores <code>SIGQUIT</code>.
If job control is in effect (see <a href="Job-Control.html">Job Control</a>), Bash
ignores <code>SIGTTIN</code>, <code>SIGTTOU</code>, and <code>SIGTSTP</code>.
</p>
<p>Non-builtin commands started by Bash have signal handlers set to the
values inherited by the shell from its parent.
When job control is not in effect, asynchronous commands
ignore <code>SIGINT</code> and <code>SIGQUIT</code> in addition to these inherited
handlers.
Commands run as a result of
command substitution ignore the keyboard-generated job control signals
<code>SIGTTIN</code>, <code>SIGTTOU</code>, and <code>SIGTSTP</code>.
</p>
<p>The shell exits by default upon receipt of a <code>SIGHUP</code>.
Before exiting, an interactive shell resends the <code>SIGHUP</code> to
all jobs, running or stopped.
Stopped jobs are sent <code>SIGCONT</code> to ensure that they receive
the <code>SIGHUP</code>.
To prevent the shell from sending the <code>SIGHUP</code> signal to a
particular job, it should be removed
from the jobs table with the <code>disown</code>
builtin (see <a href="Job-Control-Builtins.html">Job Control Builtins</a>) or marked
to not receive <code>SIGHUP</code> using <code>disown -h</code>.
</p>
<p>If the  <code>huponexit</code> shell option has been set with <code>shopt</code>
(see <a href="The-Shopt-Builtin.html">The Shopt Builtin</a>), Bash sends a <code>SIGHUP</code> to all jobs when
an interactive login shell exits.
</p>
<p>If Bash is waiting for a command to complete and receives a signal
for which a trap has been set, the trap will not be executed until
the command completes.
When Bash is waiting for an asynchronous
command via the <code>wait</code> builtin, the reception of a signal for
which a trap has been set will cause the <code>wait</code> builtin to return
immediately with an exit status greater than 128, immediately after
which the trap is executed.
</p>
<p>When job control is not enabled, and Bash is waiting for a foreground
command to complete, the shell receives keyboard-generated signals
such as <code>SIGINT</code> (usually generated by &lsquo;<samp>^C</samp>&rsquo;) that users
commonly intend to send to that command.
This happens because the shell and the command are in the same process
group as the terminal, and &lsquo;<samp>^C</samp>&rsquo; sends <code>SIGINT</code> to all processes
in that process group.
See <a href="Job-Control.html">Job Control</a>, for a more in-depth discussion of process groups.
</p>
<p>When Bash is running without job control enabled and receives <code>SIGINT</code>
while waiting for a foreground command, it waits until that foreground
command terminates and then decides what to do about the <code>SIGINT</code>:
</p>
<ol>
<li> If the command terminates due to the <code>SIGINT</code>, Bash concludes
that the user meant to end the entire script, and acts on the
<code>SIGINT</code> (e.g., by running a <code>SIGINT</code> trap or exiting itself);

</li><li> If the pipeline does not terminate due to <code>SIGINT</code>, the program
handled the <code>SIGINT</code> itself and did not treat it as a fatal signal.
In that case, Bash does not treat <code>SIGINT</code> as a fatal signal,
either, instead assuming that the <code>SIGINT</code> was used as part of the
program&rsquo;s normal operation (e.g., <code>emacs</code> uses it to abort editing
commands) or deliberately discarded. However, Bash will run any
trap set on <code>SIGINT</code>, as it does with any other trapped signal it
receives while it is waiting for the foreground command to
complete, for compatibility.
</li></ol>
