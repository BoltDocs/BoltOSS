<p>When Bash is interactive, in the absence of any traps,
it ignores <code class="code">SIGTERM</code>
(so that &lsquo;<samp class="samp">kill 0</samp>&rsquo; does not kill an interactive shell),
and catches and handles <code class="code">SIGINT</code>
(so that the <code class="code">wait</code> builtin is interruptible).
When Bash receives a <code class="code">SIGINT</code>, it breaks out of any executing loops.
In all cases, Bash ignores <code class="code">SIGQUIT</code>.
If job control is in effect (see <a class="pxref" href="Job-Control.html">Job Control</a>), Bash
ignores <code class="code">SIGTTIN</code>, <code class="code">SIGTTOU</code>, and <code class="code">SIGTSTP</code>.
</p>
<p>The <code class="code">trap</code> builtin modifies the shell&rsquo;s signal handling, as
described below (see <a class="pxref" href="Bourne-Shell-Builtins.html">Bourne Shell Builtins</a>.
</p>
<p>Non-builtin commands Bash executes have signal handlers set to the
values inherited by the shell from its parent,
unless <code class="code">trap</code> sets them to be ignored, in which case the child
process will ignore them as well.
When job control is not in effect, asynchronous commands
ignore <code class="code">SIGINT</code> and <code class="code">SIGQUIT</code> in addition to these inherited
handlers.
Commands run as a result of
command substitution ignore the keyboard-generated job control signals
<code class="code">SIGTTIN</code>, <code class="code">SIGTTOU</code>, and <code class="code">SIGTSTP</code>.
</p>
<p>The shell exits by default upon receipt of a <code class="code">SIGHUP</code>.
Before exiting, an interactive shell resends the <code class="code">SIGHUP</code> to
all jobs, running or stopped.
The shell sends <code class="code">SIGCONT</code> to stopped jobs to ensure that they
receive the <code class="code">SIGHUP</code>
(See <a class="xref" href="Job-Control.html">Job Control</a>, for more information about running and stopped jobs).
To prevent the shell from sending the <code class="code">SIGHUP</code> signal to a
particular job, remove it from the jobs table with the <code class="code">disown</code>
builtin (see <a class="pxref" href="Job-Control-Builtins.html">Job Control Builtins</a>) or mark it
not to receive <code class="code">SIGHUP</code> using <code class="code">disown -h</code>.
</p>
<p>If the  <code class="code">huponexit</code> shell option has been set using <code class="code">shopt</code>
(see <a class="pxref" href="The-Shopt-Builtin.html">The Shopt Builtin</a>), Bash sends a <code class="code">SIGHUP</code> to all jobs when
an interactive login shell exits.
</p>
<p>If Bash is waiting for a command to complete and receives a signal
for which a trap has been set,
it will not execute the trap until the command completes.
If Bash is waiting for an asynchronous command via the <code class="code">wait</code> builtin,
and it receives a signal for which a trap has been set,
the <code class="code">wait</code> builtin will return immediately with an exit status
greater than 128, immediately after which the shell executes the trap.
</p>
<p>When job control is not enabled, and Bash is waiting for a foreground
command to complete, the shell receives keyboard-generated signals
such as <code class="code">SIGINT</code> (usually generated by &lsquo;<samp class="samp">^C</samp>&rsquo;) that users
commonly intend to send to that command.
This happens because the shell and the command are in the same process
group as the terminal, and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">^C</samp>&rsquo; sends <code class="code">SIGINT</code> to all processes
in that process group.
Since Bash does not enable job control by default when the
shell is not interactive,
this scenario is most common in non-interactive shells.
</p>
<p>When job control is enabled, and Bash is waiting for a foreground
command to complete, the shell does not receive keyboard-generated
signals, because it is not in the same process group as the terminal.
This scenario is most common in interactive shells, where Bash
attempts to enable job control by default.
See <a class="ref" href="Job-Control.html">Job Control</a>, for a more in-depth discussion of process groups.
</p>
<p>When job control is not enabled, and Bash receives <code class="code">SIGINT</code>
while waiting for a foreground command, it waits until that foreground
command terminates and then decides what to do about the <code class="code">SIGINT</code>:
</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li> If the command terminates due to the <code class="code">SIGINT</code>, Bash concludes
that the user meant to send the <code class="code">SIGINT</code> to the shell as well,
and acts on the
<code class="code">SIGINT</code>
(e.g., by running a <code class="code">SIGINT</code> trap,
exiting a non-interactive shell,
or returning to the top level to read a new command).

</li><li> If the command does not terminate due to <code class="code">SIGINT</code>, the program
handled the <code class="code">SIGINT</code> itself and did not treat it as a fatal signal.
In that case, Bash does not treat <code class="code">SIGINT</code> as a fatal signal,
either, instead assuming that the <code class="code">SIGINT</code> was used as part of the
program&rsquo;s normal operation (e.g., <code class="command">emacs</code> uses it to abort editing
commands) or deliberately discarded.
However, Bash will run any
trap set on <code class="code">SIGINT</code>, as it does with any other trapped signal it
receives while it is waiting for the foreground command to
complete, for compatibility.
</li></ol>

<p>When job control is enabled, Bash does not receive keyboard-generated
signals such as <code class="code">SIGINT</code>
while it is waiting for a foreground command.
An interactive shell does not pay attention to the <code class="code">SIGINT</code>,
even if the foreground command terminates as a result, other than noting
its exit status.
If the shell is not interactive, and
the foreground command terminates due to the <code class="code">SIGINT</code>,
Bash pretends it received the <code class="code">SIGINT</code>
itself (scenario 1 above), for compatibility.
